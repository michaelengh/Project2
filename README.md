# Income Project - overview and model usability

## This was a project made to analyze the data in order to determine if there is a coorelation between an individuals data and their income.

### Why:
We have historical data about an individual when it comes to categories like identity, schooling, working hours, profits, and losses. We would like to see if the coorelation between those data points can give a reflection on best categorical outcomes for the highest potential to make over $50,000 a year. 

### data:
* I created a few charts for a more simplistic understanding of the data points to see a simplified visual that there is a potential for some coorelation within the data

With the charts we can see: (fig1) Coorelation between capital gains and education. (Fig2) There is roughly 75% of individuals that make less than $50,000 a year. (Fig3) Coorelation map that shows a few item catagories like the higher the education the better chance at a larger capitral gain and the older you are  more likely to work longer hours are a couple examples.  

### Modeling and predictions
I created 2 different models trying to predict the income of an individual based off the data received. I used the KNN model and also a randomforestclassifier model. The rff model worked well with an 83% accuracy rate in predictions but the model i choose is the knn with a slighly highier correct prediction rate. 

### Usability
we could use the models with future individuals in showing them their chances of making over $50,000 a year by making a few life decision changes. like a person would have a better chance of hitting that goal if they increased their education and hours worked, or if being married and deciding on a profession will change their chances. just a modeling tool to help predict if a persons life choices will impact their income.
